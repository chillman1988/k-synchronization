# K-Synchronisation  
### *Galactic Interference Gravity from Quantum Coherence in Cosmic Light*

> **"The Hilbert space is pure potential. The light we see is not mass — it is the interference pattern of cosmic possibility. From this pattern, gravity emerges — not as curvature of space, but as modulation of coherence."**

## Abstract

We reconstruct a **correlation field** \( K(r) \) from the observed light distribution \( I(r) \).  
This field adds a **long-range, nonlocal term** to the effective potential:
$$
\Phi_\text{eff}(r) = \Phi_N(r) + \beta K(r)
$$
Applied to **HST data of M51** (deprojected, companion masked), the model yields **flat rotation curves without dark matter**.

## Key Results (M51)

- **Newtonian (light only)**: declining curve  
- **K-Sync**: **broad, flat plateau**  
- **Robust** under \( \ell \in [40,320] \), \( \beta \in [0.4,1.6] \)
