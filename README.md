# K-Synchronisation  
### *Galactic Interference Gravity from Quantum Coherence*

> **"The Hilbert space is pure potential. The light we see is not mass — it is the interference pattern of cosmic possibility. From this pattern, gravity emerges — not as curvature of space, but as modulation of coherence."**
