Correlation in Spacetime

First Postulate: The thing in itself does not exist (at least not from our perspective). (Kant)

Second Postulate: Whoever is part of a system cannot comprehend it, only shape it. (This should not be difficult for an engineer to acknowledge, since engineers prefer to act practically.)

Third Postulate: Every act of fragmentation (definition) is therefore a creative act, because through it new degrees of freedom are realized.

Relation to Quantum Mechanics: 
In quantum mechanics, the Hilbert space represents a pure probability distribution. A measurement realizes a specific state within measurable reality (Copenhagen interpretation). The interference pattern can be understood as a projection of this probability distribution—indicating where the system exhibits stronger or weaker correlations.
In this sense, light becomes a holographic proxy that indirectly conveys the correlational information of the system through approximation.

Galaxies and Astrophysics: 
When we look at the rotation velocities of galaxies, we find that they remain flat. Normally, to make the equations “work,” an additional mass distribution in the outer regions—dark matter—is postulated, although it has never been empirically detected.
However, as previously outlined (if we take quantum mechanics seriously), light does not primarily convey mass distribution (no thing in itself), but rather the correlational structure of the formation in terms of its Hilbert space.

If that is the case, then flat rotation curves can be assumed to result from a concentric correlation coupling (also known as time dilation) rather than from dark matter. From this, we can define a vector and derive a field that represents the correlational structure of the galaxy.
By applying this field structure to different datasets, we can test whether it consistently reproduces flat rotation curves.
Once this coupling field is empirically confirmed, we gain a new foundation for synchronization, because we can extract a term for correlation from photometric analysis.
